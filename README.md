# The Efficacy of Virtual Reality Training in the Military

This research project evaluates the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) training in modern military contexts. Conducted in collaboration with the Rhode Island Air National Guard, it uses a mixed-method approach combining interviews, data analysis, and literature review.

## Focus Areas
- Situational awareness and decision-making
- VR vs. traditional training
- Cost reduction and training efficiency
- Challenges of real-world transferability

## Key Takeaways
- VR boosts retention up to 75% vs. 5â€“10% from classroom methods
- Scenarios like aircraft maintenance, combat drills, and trauma care can be safely simulated
- Integration of VR in hybrid models (with live drills) is recommended
